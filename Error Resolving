1. Issue tomcat server was down. Here are the steps i have taken to resolve the issue:
============================================================================================

To check if Apache Tomcat is active (running), there are several ways depending on your operating system and setup.

âœ… If Youâ€™re on Linux / macOS:
1. Check if Tomcat Process is Running
ps aux | grep tomcat

Look for lines that include java and your Tomcat installation path. If found, Tomcat is likely running.

2. Check Listening Port (default is 8080)
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 8080

or

sudo lsof -i :8080


If something is listening on port 8080, Tomcat is likely active.

3. Use curl or browser
curl http://localhost:8080


You should see the Tomcat welcome page HTML or at least a response.

Or, in a browser:
ðŸ‘‰ Go to http://localhost:8080

4. Tomcat Logs

Go to your Tomcat folder â†’ logs/ â†’ open catalina.out

tail -f /path/to/tomcat/logs/catalina.out


Check for startup success messages or errors.

âœ… If Youâ€™re on Windows:
1. Check via Task Manager

Open Task Manager

Look for a Java process (often running Tomcat)

2. Check Services (if installed as a service)

Press Win + R, type services.msc, and hit Enter

Look for Apache Tomcat [version]

Check if itâ€™s Running

3. Command Prompt
netstat -ano | findstr :8080


If a PID is listening on port 8080, match it in Task Manager to verify itâ€™s Tomcat.

âœ… Bonus: Use Tomcat Manager (Web Interface)

If enabled, go to:

http://localhost:8080/manager/html


Log in with the admin credentials (defined in tomcat-users.xml), and you'll see app status and controls.

Would you like help confirming which OS youâ€™re on or where your Tomcat is installed?


âœ… Next Steps to Confirm or Start Tomcat:
1. Try starting Tomcat manually

If Tomcat is installed in /opt, try:

cd /opt/tomcat/bin
./startup.sh


If it starts successfully, youâ€™ll see output like:

Tomcat started.

2. Check if it's running again

After startup, re-run:

ps aux | grep tomcat


You should now see a Java process associated with Tomcat.

3. Check access via browser or curl
curl http://localhost:8080


Or, from your browser:

http://<your-server-public-ip>:8080

4. Check logs if startup fails

If it doesnâ€™t start, check logs:

cat /opt/tomcat/logs/catalina.out
